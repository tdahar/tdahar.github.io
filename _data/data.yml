career-summary: 

  Junior Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience who is willing to learn and keep growing.<br>
  My passion is to program and automate tasks and processes.<br>
  At a professional level, I have worked in three different companies, with three different roles;
  Infrastructure Engineer, IT Security Consultant and Research Engineer (which involved programming and data analysis). 

  I prefer to work in a medium size team, big enough to share my ideas with a group of people, as well as learning from them, 
  but small enough so I get to know the team. I consider myself autonomous enough to find the solutions on my own, 
  but I like having someone in the team who is specialized in some technology.
